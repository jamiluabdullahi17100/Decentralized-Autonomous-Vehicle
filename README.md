# Decentralized Autonomous Vehicle (DAV) Network

A blockchain-powered platform enabling autonomous vehicles to operate in a decentralized network, handling vehicle registration, ride coordination, maintenance tracking, and automated insurance processing.

## System Overview

The DAV Network creates a trustless ecosystem where autonomous vehicles can safely and efficiently serve riders while maintaining transparent records of operations, maintenance, and insurance coverage.

### Core Smart Contracts

#### Vehicle Registration Contract
Manages the digital identity and credentials of autonomous vehicles:
- Vehicle onboarding and verification
- Ownership registration and transfers
- Operating license management
- Performance history tracking
- Vehicle capability specifications
- Compliance certification storage

#### Ride Contract
Coordinates ride services and vehicle dispatching:
- Ride request processing
- Dynamic route optimization
- Fare calculation and collection
- Vehicle-rider matching
- Real-time location tracking
- Service quality monitoring
- Payment distribution

#### Maintenance Contract
Tracks and manages vehicle maintenance:
- Preventive maintenance scheduling
- Service history recording
- Parts replacement tracking
- Performance diagnostics
- Maintenance provider verification
- Compliance monitoring
- Service quality assurance

#### Insurance Contract
Handles dynamic insurance coverage:
- Per-ride coverage activation
- Risk assessment
- Premium calculation
- Automated claim processing
- Incident reporting
- Coverage verification
- Liability management

## Technical Implementation

git clone https://github.com/your-org/dav-network.git
cd dav-network
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Set required environment variables:

```

## Usage Examples

### Register Vehicle

```solidity
await VehicleRegistrationContract.registerVehicle({
    vehicleId: "AV-123456",
    specifications: {
        manufacturer: "AutoTech",
        model: "AT2025",
        capacity: 4,
        autonomyLevel: 5
    },
    certifications: ["ISO-AV-2025", "SAFETY-TIER-1"],
    ownerAddress: "0x..."
});
```

### Process Ride Request

```solidity
await RideContract.createRideRequest({
    pickupLocation: {
        lat: 40.7128,
        long: -74.0060
    },
    dropoffLocation: {
        lat: 40.7589,
        long: -73.9851
    },
    passengers: 2,
    requestTime: Date.now(),
    specialRequirements: []
});
```

### Schedule Maintenance

```solidity
await MaintenanceContract.scheduleService({
    vehicleId: "AV-123456",
    serviceType: "ROUTINE_INSPECTION",
    provider: "CERTIFIED_SERVICE_CENTER_1",
    scheduledTime: Date.now() + 86400000,
    estimatedDuration: 7200
});
```

## Security Features

- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
- Real-time vehicle monitoring
- Encrypted communication channels
- Emergency shutdown capabilities
- Automated safety checks
- Secure key management
- Regular security audits

## IoT Integration

### Vehicle Sensors
```javascript
class VehicleSensor {
    async reportMetrics() {
        const metrics = await this.gatherSensorData();
        await MaintenanceContract.updateMetrics(metrics);
    }
}
```

### GPS Tracking
```javascript
class LocationTracker {
    async updateLocation(coordinates) {
        await RideContract.updateVehicleLocation(coordinates);
    }
}
```

## Testing

Run comprehensive tests:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

Generate coverage report:
```bash
npx hardhat coverage
```

## API Documentation
